# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The aim is to provide a weather dashboard that runs in the browser to display user-defined data retrieved from Open Weather Map (https://openweathermap.org/).

All dates are retrieved from day.js and displayed in a user-friendly format.

The names of cities searched are saved into local storage so that the data persists when the page is reloaded.

It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The project involved updating the HTML and CSS code and writing the JavaScript code to give the application its functionality, with attention paid to the use of day.js and the retrieval of data from a third-party API.

## Installation

n/a

## Usage

The user can enter the name of a city in the search box and click 'search'.

The relevant data for that city is then displayed, with the current weather conditions shown at the top and the 5-day forecast shown underneath.

Each time a city name is searched, a button appears under the main search box, with the name of that city. The user can then click any of these buttons at a later point to view again the weather data for that city.

All search history buttons will persist when the page is reloaded.
